# R2RPC Spring Boot Starter

Spring Boot 2 starter for [R2RPC](https://github.com/mostroverkhov/r2) - [RSocket](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket) based RPC framework with pluggable serialization.

Simplifies creation of `R2RPC` servers by providing:

* sensible auto-configuration (simple `ServerRSocketFactory`, `JSON` serialization and `TCP` transport)
* declarative definition of server endpoints (YAML is preferred)  

```yaml
r2rpc:
 server:
  defaults:
    codecs: [jackson]
    transport: tcp
  endpoints:
    - name: foo
      port: 8083
      api: [baz, bar]
```
Custom transports can be provided as `@R2ServerTransport` annotated Spring beans, and custom codecs - with `@R2DataCodec`.

`api` is set of API interfaces annotated with `R2Api(name)`, each aggregates [R2RPC](https://github.com/mostroverkhov/r2) service definitions. Its implementation serves as Endpoint handler, and must be provided to Spring with 
`ServerApiProvider` bean for each API implementation.   

API definitions allow to group related R2RPC services in one namespace so they can be shared more conveniently.

Single API definition, referred in configuration as `api:[example]`, can be as follows

```
@R2Api("example")
public interface ExampleApi {

  BazContract bazContract();
  
  BarContract barContract();
}
```
`BazContract` and `BarContract` are R2RPC service definitions, e.g.

```java
@Service("baz")
public interface BazContract {

  @RequestStream("bazStream")
  Flux<Baz> baz(Baz baz);
}
```

API definition is exposed to Spring with `ServerApiProvider<ExampleApiImpl>` implementation,
where `ExampleApiImpl` is implementation of `ExampleApi` providing handlers for incoming 
requests.
```java
public class BarApiProvider implements ServerApiProvider<BarApiImpl> {

  @Override
  public BarApiImpl apply(ConnectionContext connectionContext) {
    return new BarApiImpl();
  }
}
```
API definitions are constrained by following rules
* All definitions must have unique names. If several implementations of same API are necessary, 
override name on implementation itself by annotating It with `@R2API(newName)`
* API implementation (handler) must implement at most 1 (one) API definition
* API implementations per endpoint must contribute API definitions of unique type 
  (in other words, no more than one implementation of particular API per endpoint)

### Examples

Example module contains simple self-contained runnable application - `R2rpcStarterExampleApplicaton`.
